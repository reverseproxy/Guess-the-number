# Guess the number game
A basic python guess the number game. The script prompts for the year you were born, the computer than looks up the current year, and deducts this year from it. 

A random number is then added to this value, and you have to keep guessing the number until you win the game. 

The script gives you the number if needed in order win the game

This was the first python project I wrote, because I'm still learning. I've added comments for anyone who is attempting to learn too

My method of thinking as to how I designed it

 - What do I want it to do? (e.g Prompt a question, require a user input, do some mathematics, add a random number, do some guesses)
 - What do I need for it to work? (Computer needs to do maths, do verification, and a loop)
 
 This helped me work out what to google when designing it. Probably has errors, but it works.
